***Story About Sawyer***

Becoming a Musician…

Sawyer Jay began learning and playing music at an early age. He took piano lessons, played the saxophone in the school band and sang in the school choir. All of this musical knowledge aided him when he began to teach himself guitar, and later the banjo and harmonica, during his high school years. 

After graduating high school, Sawyer Jay’s love of music led him to Nashville, Tennessee. While living in Nashville, he navigated through the cut throat music scene of the music city. The obstacles of big record companies and booking agencies didn’t stop him. He played at the famous Bluebird Cafe, The Five Spot, The Underground and, like many up and coming musicians, busked for tips on Broadway Street. While in Nashville he was fortunate enough to share the stage with many musicians including, Tim Boucher and Samantha Mouchet.

After a year of living in the music city, Sawyer Jay returned to his home in Lincoln, Nebraska, where he continued to perform and play music. He played solo shows as well as playing in multiple bands at local venues such as; The Zoo Bar, Knickerbockers, Duffy’s Tavern and others. 

Following every show Sawyer Jay has played, his fan base has continued to grow. As a result, he has been invited to perform at the Nebraska State Fair and multiple county fairs throughout the midwest.  

Currently, Sawyer Jay resides in Lincoln, Nebraska. He plays shows at a variety of venues including; bars, wineries, weddings, private parties and any occasions that need music.
